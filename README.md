# Titanic Gender Submission – EDA

This repository contains a short exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic `gender_submission.csv` dataset from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on basic data inspection, missing value checks, survival distribution visualization, and simple observations.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle Titanic Competition
- **File Used:** `gender_submission.csv`
- **Columns:** PassengerId, Survived

## Key Highlights
- No missing or duplicate values
- Imbalanced survival distribution
- PassengerId has no analytical relevance
- Dataset is intended for submission, not deep EDA

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Purpose
This project is intended for academic practice and demonstration of basic EDA techniques.
